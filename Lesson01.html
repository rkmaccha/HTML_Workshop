        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
        a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
        such as JavaScript.

    Fun fact: all websites use HTML — even this one. It’s a fundamental part of every web developer’s toolkit. HTML
    provides the content that gives web pages structure, by using elements and tags, you can add text, images, videos,
    forms, and more. Learning HTML basics is an important first step in your web development journey and an essential
    skill for front- and back-end developers.
