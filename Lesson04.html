    <p align="right">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
        displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting 
        languages such as JavaScript.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        its appearance.
